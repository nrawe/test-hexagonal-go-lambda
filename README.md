# Test: Hexagonal Microservice using Go and AWS Lambda

The purpose of this repo is to be a sample of building a microservice using
AWS Lambda, Go, and Hexagonal (or Ports & Adapters) architecture. I couldn't
find a good example of this anywhere, and some of this is probably wrong: take
with the pinch of salt its intended with.

This is inspired by the examples from Alistair Cockburn such as
[SmallerWebHexagon](https://github.com/totheralistair/SmallWebHexagon).
Personally, I've always found this to be a simple, but somewhat obtuse concept
and the examples haven't gotten the essence of it right (when contrasting
with AC's example).
